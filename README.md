# Task 1: software configuration
## Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?
I decided to take part in this competition because Dare it, Activision and Blizzard companies gave a great opportunity to people from Ukraine :ukraine: , who are now in Poland, to gain new knowledge and find a job in the IT field.

Since childhood I have been interested in everything related to computers, studied in the field of computer technology, and recently I have found the ability to find errors in processes and mark them. I believe that these two things can be perfectly combined for me in the field of QA.
